# sci.ts
Science TypeScript Library (sci.ts) is a collection of functions and classes
for science, mathematics and engineering based and made on TypeScript, inspired
on other science libraries for other languages.

## Features
sci.ts is a work in progress, hence we've only implemented the next few 
features:
- LOL!

## Installation
The recommended way to install std.ts is through Node Package Manager.

```bash
$ npm install --save sci.ts 
```

## Usage
> Still a work in progress. However, sci.ts is build using typescript so 
resulting types definition may help you to uncover all functions inside this 
classes.
Furthermore, you can check the examples on this repository while we work on 
our documentation.

For JavaScript:

```javascript

```

For TypeScript:

```typescript

```

## Upcoming features
We're working on some features. Here is a list including what we want to 
implement on this library. Suggestions on this list or even code for this 
would be very welcome.
